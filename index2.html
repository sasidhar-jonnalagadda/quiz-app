    <h2>Here are the instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This quiz has 5 questions. Each question has 4 options, out of which one
        option will be the correct answer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each correct response adds 2 points to your score, wrong response
        deducts 2 points, and leaving the question unattempted deducts 1 point,
        so try to mark wisely.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no time limit, so you can think about each question for as long
        as you want.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Good Luck!</h2>
